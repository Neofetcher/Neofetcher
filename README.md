# Hello

I'm an offensive security practitioner focused on red teaming, penetration testing, and adversary emulation. I specialize in simulating real-world threats to identify weaknesses and improve defensive posture. Open to collaboration, knowledge sharing, and opportunities that support continued growth within the cybersecurity domain.

## Projects:

- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Vulnerable-Machine-Exploitation-Labs"> Vulnerable Machine Exploitation Labs </a>
Exploited intentionally vulnerable machines to simulate real-world attack scenarios. Performed network enumeration and vulnerability scanning. Conducted post-exploitation steps and documented findings in structured penetration test reports. Machines exploited include: Blue, Dev, and others.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Active-Directory-AD-Lab-Environment"> Active-Directory-AD-Lab-Environment </a>
This project presents a virtualized Active Directory (AD) lab environment designed for academic study, cybersecurity training, and system administration practice. The lab simulates a Windows-based domain infrastructure, including a Domain Controller, Windows clients.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Active-Directory-Lab-Exploitation"> Active Directory Lab Exploitation </a>
Simulated attacks on a vulnerable Active Directory environment, mimicking real-world internal penetration tests. Achieved domain admin privileges through privilege escalation and token impersonation techniques. Documented attack chains and mitigation strategies in detailed reports.  
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/SIEM-LAB"> Security information and event management Lab Project </a>
Deployed honeypots to monitor and log malicious activity. Gained insights into common attack vectors and adversarial tactics.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Honeypot-Project"> Cloud Honeypot Lab Project </a>
Simulated real-world security events using Nmap on Kali Linux. Queried and analyzed events using Elastic SIEM for threat detection.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Python-Keylogger"> Python Keylogger </a>
Developed a keylogger for educational use. Captures keystrokes, clipboard data, and system info while running stealthily in the background.
