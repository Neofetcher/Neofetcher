# Hello

Cybersecurity graduate with hands-on experience in penetration testing, Active Directory exploitation, and SIEM-based threat detection. Skilled in Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, Elastic SIEM, and Microsoft Defender, with a strong foundation in vulnerability assessment, privilege escalation, and security monitoring.

Experienced in Windows and Linux environments, Python-based security scripting, and building self-hosted security labs to simulate real-world attacks and defenses. Actively pursuing certifications and seeking entry-level opportunities in SOC, penetration testing, or cybersecurity analyst roles.

## Projects:

- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Vulnerable-Machine-Exploitation-Labs"> Vulnerable Machine Exploitation Labs </a>
Exploited intentionally vulnerable machines to simulate real-world attack scenarios. Performed network enumeration and vulnerability scanning. Conducted post-exploitation steps and documented findings in structured penetration test reports. Machines exploited include: Blue, Dev, and others.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Active-Directory-AD-Lab-Environment"> Active-Directory-AD-Lab-Environment </a>
This project presents a virtualized Active Directory (AD) lab environment designed for academic study, cybersecurity training, and system administration practice. The lab simulates a Windows-based domain infrastructure, including a Domain Controller, Windows clients.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Active-Directory-Lab-Exploitation"> Active Directory Lab Exploitation </a>
Simulated attacks on a vulnerable Active Directory environment, mimicking real-world internal penetration tests. Achieved domain admin privileges through privilege escalation and token impersonation techniques. Documented attack chains and mitigation strategies in detailed reports.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/AWS-VPC-Creation-and-Hardening"> AWS-VPC-Creation-and-Hardening </a>
This project focuses on designing, deploying, and securing an AWS Virtual Private Cloud following security best practices. The goal is to create a segmented network, limit exposure to the internet, and apply defense in depth controls at the network level.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Honeypot-Project"> Cloud Honeypot Lab Project </a>
Simulated real-world security events using Nmap on Kali Linux. Queried and analyzed events using Elastic SIEM for threat detection.
- <a href = "https://github.com/Neofetcher/Python-Keylogger"> Python Keylogger </a>
Developed a keylogger for educational use. Captures keystrokes, clipboard data, and system info while running stealthily in the background.
